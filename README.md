## Strugz

This assignment was a definite challenge for me, but in the end I am so happy with everything that was achieved. I did struggle for a long time trying to get changes made in my schema file and databases into my migrations pages and up onto heroku. But after a few hours of chasing errors, I finally figured it out and was so pleased. I also got a bit hectic towards the end and started rushing my styling, so CSS and HTML are a bit of an inefficient, un-DRY mess.. I can definitely do better!
